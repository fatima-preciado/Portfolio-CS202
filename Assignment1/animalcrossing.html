                    I remember watching my cousin play Animal Crossing on the GameCube. I was very invested in watching her gift the villagers items. 
                    I was finally able to experience this when I got New Leaf on my DS! 
                    I loved New Leaf but got bored very quickly & often reset my village until I had Fauna as my villager. She changed everything, and I did my very best to make sure she never left me.

                    More recently, I started playing New Horizons, and I've managed to accumulate over 2000 hours on it since its release.
